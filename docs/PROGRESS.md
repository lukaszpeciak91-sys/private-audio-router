# Progress

State reflects evidence, not aspiration.

## DONE

- Project concept established.
- Primary use case defined.
- Preliminary research completed.
- Android communication-device APIs identified conceptually.
- Safety boundaries established.
- Repository foundation established.
- Repository-first documentation ownership and evidence-driven workflow established.
- Stable AI-session onboarding context added.
- Android application bootstrap completed with Kotlin, Compose, Material 3, and a reproducible Gradle build.
- Observe-only audio diagnostic implemented using public Android APIs, with current-state snapshots, device callbacks, an in-memory event log, and plain-text clipboard report copying.
- Observe-only audio diagnostic compile failure fixed by removing the unavailable `TYPE_ECHO_REFERENCE` device-type label.
- A physical-device observation (device/build metadata not yet recorded) found that ChatGPT Voice start was temporally correlated with `MODE_NORMAL` changing to `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`, the communication device changing from the built-in earpiece to the built-in speaker, and speakerphone changing from off to on; ending Voice correlated with the reverse changes. This is an observation, not universal behavior or proof of causation.
- Safe one-shot earpiece-routing PoC implemented: an explicitly armed run can react once to the observed communication state, request the built-in earpiece with the public API, retain diagnostic evidence, and clear its request on session exit, user action, priority modes, or clean activity destruction.

## CURRENT

- **Implementation state: the diagnostic now contains the deliberately temporary PR #5 one-shot routing experiment. Automated validation can establish code safety properties, but cross-application audible behavior remains NOT TESTED until POC-1 runs on physical hardware.**

## NEXT

- Run POC-1 on physical Android hardware and record complete device, Android, Private Audio build, and ChatGPT version metadata with the copied report.
- Determine whether Android accepts the background-process request, subsequently reports the earpiece active, and audibly routes ChatGPT Voice to it; keep these as three separate observations.
- Confirm session-end and explicit cleanup leave no abnormal system-audio behavior.

## UNKNOWN

- Whether current ChatGPT Voice respects a communication-device request from an independent application.
- Whether ChatGPT immediately overrides such a request.
- Whether Gemini behaves similarly.
- Whether browser-based voice sessions use compatible communication routing.
- OEM-specific routing differences.
- Exact behavior during incoming and outgoing real phone calls.
- Whether a foreground service will eventually be required.
- Whether communication-device callbacks are delivered while this application is backgrounded on tested Android/OEM builds, and whether process lifetime interrupts an experiment.
